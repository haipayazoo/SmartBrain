## Smart Brain

A full stack web application that allows users to register an account and sign-in. The web application takes a URL link to an image and, using the Clarifai API, detects the position where the face is detected an inserts a blue border around the image of the face.

If you want to check out the web application, it is hosted on Heroku here: https://haipa-smartbrain.herokuapp.com/ Although, the passwords stored into the PostgreSQL database are hashed, it is best that you do not register with any legitimate information.
